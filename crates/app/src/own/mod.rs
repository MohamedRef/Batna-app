//! Mohamed's own cards (PARITY 7.6–7.7): the "add a card" form, the list on
//! the Study screen, and cards shared in from other apps on Android.
//!
//! The cards are one extra deck, `batna_core::own::lecture`, that the study
//! player treats like a book lecture. The review backend publishes it here
//! whenever it reloads, so imports and Batna Cloud changes show up too.
