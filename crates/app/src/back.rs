//! System Back (the Android gesture or button) moves back inside Batna.
//!
//! wry's Android activity only handles Back while the WebView can go back in
//! its history, and otherwise sends the app to the background. So while
//! there is somewhere to go back to, one "trap" history entry is kept; Back
//! pops it, and Batna steps back in this order:
//! 1. the topmost on-screen control marked `data-back="true"` (the Settings
//!    sheet's back or close, a player's ×, "Stay" in a leave-session
//!    confirm), clicked as if tapped;
//! 2. the previous screen, then Today.
//!
//! On Today with nothing open no entry is kept (one left over from a sheet
//! closed by tap is popped), so Back leaves Batna as Android users expect.
// adapted from kabar-app main: crates/app/src/back.rs
//!
//! On Android the Back key itself goes to the page first (`BackKey.kt` in
//! android/, `__batnaNativeBack` in system-back.js), because WebView skips
//! history entries added without a tap and would then let Android close
//! Batna from any screen. The history trap stays as a fallback.
