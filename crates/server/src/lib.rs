//! Batna Cloud: Google sign-in, the device registry and the per-account sync
//! hub. A separate free Cloudflare Worker with its own storage and secrets;
//! it shares nothing with Kabar Cloud.
//!
//! Everything outside `wasm` is plain Rust, tested natively against real
//! SQLite. `wasm` binds it to the Cloudflare runtime (Worker + Durable Object).
// adapted from kabar-app main: crates/server (auth, devices and sync only:
// no AI, TTS, push or blobs).
