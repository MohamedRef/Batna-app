//! Synced (LWW) settings that screens keep in globals for speed: the plan,

//! an import) must call [`reload`], or the next local save would write the
//! stale copy back with a newer timestamp and undo the other device (#32).

/// Re-reads every synced-setting global from the store. Each one only
/// changes (and re-renders) when its value really did.
