//! The info sheet: what a tap opens to tell more (a book page's sheet, from
//! every "ص N" chip). A bottom sheet in its own raised colour (`--sheet`,
//! tested per theme in `batna_core::theme`) that Mohamed resizes by its
//! handle: free dragging, with a pull towards a peek, half and near-full
//! stop, a fling to the next stop, and a drag (or fling) down to close. It
//! reopens at the size it was left. There is no scrim: the page under it
//! keeps scrolling, and the chip that opened it is scrolled above it.
//!
//! Adapted from kabar-app main: crates/app/src/sheet.rs (PR #453). The
//! gestures live in `assets/sheet.js`, installed once by [`use_gestures`]:
//! a drag must follow the finger frame by frame, which a round trip to Rust
//! per pointer move can't do on a phone. It closes the sheet by clicking its
//! close button, so Rust stays the one owner of what is open.
