# Batna Cloud: sync between the Mac, the phone and the tablet

Batna Cloud is a small Rust Cloudflare Worker (`crates/server`) on the **Workers Free** plan. It is Batna's own: its own Worker name (`batna-cloud`), its own Durable Object storage, its own Google OAuth client and its own secrets. Nothing is shared with Kabar Cloud. Parts of the code are adapted from Kabar's `crates/server` and `crates/app/src/cloud` (credited in each file).

It does three things:

1. **Sign-in**: checks your Google ID token against an allowlist (your Gmail only) and issues Batna tokens: a 15-minute access token and a 60-day refresh token that rotates on every use.
2. **Devices**: lists every signed-in device with its last sync, and signs one out remotely (its socket closes at once).
3. **Live sync**: one Durable Object per account is the WebSocket hub (hibernation, so idle sockets cost nothing). It keeps the op log; your reviews and settings arrive on the other devices within seconds.

Cost: **$0**. Nothing here needs a card on file. There is no D1 database, no R2 and no AI.

## 1. What syncs

| Table | Rule | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| `review_events` | append-only (a delete is a tombstone) | every review: item, grade, time |
| `item_status` | last writer wins (HLC) | your ✓ / ✎ / ✗ content checks |
| `settings` | last writer wins (HLC) | retention, new items a day and other study settings |

The list lives in `batna_protocol::sync::TABLES`. **A new synced table must be added there**, or the hub rejects its ops as `unknown_table`. A device only sends rows it wrote itself (its own `device_id`), and a clock more than 5 minutes ahead is rejected.

## 2. Layout

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Worker routes | `crates/server/src/wasm/mod.rs` |
| Durable Object `Account` (devices + op log in DO SQLite) | `crates/server/src/wasm/account.rs`, `src/account.rs`, `src/devices.rs` |
| Sync hub logic (tested natively against SQLite) | `crates/server/src/hub.rs` |
| Tokens, Google ID-token check | `crates/server/src/tokens.rs`, `src/google.rs` |
| Wire types, merge rules, client state machine | `crates/protocol/src/{sync,cloud,merge,client}.rs` |
| App engine (sign-in, keychain, WebSocket, backoff) | `crates/app/src/cloud/` |
| Outbox and remote merge | `crates/app/src/store/sync.rs` (`sync_outbox`, migration 2) |
| Settings screen | Settings › المزامنة (`crates/app/src/cloud/ui.rs`) |

## 3. Setup (once, about 15 minutes)

### 3.1 Cloudflare
1. Use your free Cloudflare account (or create one at <https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up>; no card).
2. On the Mac:
   ```bash
   just cloud-tools      # wrangler 4 + worker-build
   wrangler login        # opens the browser
   just cloud-setup      # token signing key + your Gmail on the allowlist (Worker secrets)
   ```

### 3.2 Google sign-in (Google Cloud Console, free)
1. <https://console.cloud.google.com/> → create a **new** project "Batna" (not Kabar's).
2. **Google Auth Platform → Branding/Audience**: External, keep it in *Testing*, add your Gmail as a test user.
3. **Clients → Create client → Desktop app** "Batna desktop". The Mac and Android both use it (browser sign-in with PKCE and a loopback redirect). On Android the redirect lands while Chrome is in front and Android keeps a backgrounded Batna off the network, so the app only waits for the code there; the code exchange and the Batna Cloud sign-in run once Batna is back in front (the page's "ارجع لباطنة" button opens `app.batna://signed-in`), retrying for up to nine minutes.
4. Put its client id in `crates/server/wrangler.toml`:
   ```toml
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_IDS = "1234-desktop.apps.googleusercontent.com"
   ```
   The id is not a secret; commit it.

### 3.3 Deploy
**From GitHub (no Mac needed).** The `Deploy Batna Cloud` workflow builds and deploys the Worker.
1. In Cloudflare, open **Workers & Pages** once so the account gets its `workers.dev` subdomain.
2. At **My Profile › API Tokens**, create a token from the **Edit Cloudflare Workers** template.
3. Add repo secrets (**Settings › Secrets and variables › Actions**):
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: the token.
   - `BATNA_ALLOWED_EMAILS`: your Gmail.
4. Run **Actions › Deploy Batna Cloud › Run workflow**. The run summary shows the Worker URL.

The first run makes the token signing key inside Cloudflare, so `just cloud-setup` isn't needed. After that, every push to `main` that touches `crates/server` or `crates/protocol` redeploys the hub.

**From the Mac:**
```bash
just cloud-deploy
curl https://batna-cloud.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/v1/health
```

Deploy the hub from `main` at PR #134 or later. An older hub rejects the `relay` ops that carry a restored backup to the other devices (as `wrong_device`), and the app then drops them for good. Whenever `batna_protocol::sync` changes, redeploy the hub before installing the new app. Refresh tokens rotate on use: an old one keeps working until the device presents its replacement, so a lost response or a failed Keychain/Keystore save never signs a device out, and a token that comes back after its replacement was used signs that device out. A signed-out device can't list or sign out the others, even while its access token lasts.

### 3.4 Connect the app
1. `cp .env.example .env` and fill in `BATNA_CLOUD_URL` (the URL above) and the Desktop client's id and secret. `.env` is git-ignored; `just` loads it and the app reads it at build time.
2. `just run` → **Settings › المزامنة › سجّل دخول بجوجل**. The browser opens, you pick your Gmail, and the page says to go back to Batna.
3. Build the APK the same way (`.env` in place) and sign in on the S24 Ultra and the Tab S11.
4. Review a card on one device: the review shows on the others within seconds. Until you sign in, everything stays on the device, exactly as before.

### 3.5 The preview APK (GitHub Actions)
The auto-updating preview APK is built on GitHub, where there is no `.env`. Give it the same values once, in the repo's **Settings › Secrets and variables › Actions**:

| Kind | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Secret | `BATNA_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | the Desktop client's secret |

`batna-android-preview.yml` passes them to the build on pushes to `main` only; a PR's build gets none and its APK hides sign-in. The next preview build (and the update it ships) can sign in. GitHub masks the secret in logs, and nothing writes it to the repo. Like every installed-app secret, it can be read out of the APK. That is only acceptable because the client is a **Desktop app** (installed-app) OAuth client, which Google treats as public: its "secret" grants nothing without the user's own consent and PKCE. Never put a Web-application client's secret here, because that one is truly confidential.

## 4. API

All JSON. Authenticated routes take `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. Errors are `{ "code": "...", "message": "..." }` (`ErrorCode` in `crates/protocol/src/cloud.rs`).

| Route | What |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/health` | `{ name, protocol }` |
| `POST /v1/auth/google` | `{ id_token, device }` → `Session` |
| `POST /v1/auth/refresh` | `{ refresh_token }` → new `Session` (the old refresh token stops working) |
| `POST /v1/auth/signout` | signs this device out |
| `GET /v1/devices` | `{ devices: [DeviceSummary] }` |
| `DELETE /v1/devices/{id}` | remote sign-out |
| `GET /v1/sync` | WebSocket; messages in `crates/protocol/src/sync.rs` |

Sync in one paragraph: the device sends `hello { last_seq }`, gets the missing ops in pages and `caught_up`, then pushes its outbox as `push { batch, ops ≤ 50 }` and gets an `ack` listing what can leave the outbox. Other devices' ops arrive as `ops` the moment they're stored. Merging is idempotent, so reading the log again never doubles a review.

## 5. Local development

```bash
just cloud-dev    # http://127.0.0.1:8787 (local workerd)
just cloud-logs   # live logs from the deployed Worker
cargo test -p batna-server -p batna-protocol   # hub, tokens, devices and merge rules, no network
```

## 6. Privacy and limits

- Only your reviews, checks and settings leave the device. No patient data, no book text.
- A phone moved with Smart Switch or another copy of the app's data is a new device to the hub. Android backup is off in the manifest, and on Android 12+, where a device-to-device transfer ignores that, the app notices it was copied (a marker in `no_backup/` is missing) and takes a new `device_id` with an empty outbox (`crates/app/src/store/install.rs`). Its reviews are already on the hub, so it simply syncs as a new device. Sign in again on the new phone.
- Secrets (`TOKEN_SIGNING_KEY`, `ALLOWED_EMAILS`) are Worker secrets, never in git.
- Free-plan limits (Workers 100,000 requests/day, Durable Objects 100,000 requests/day) are far above one learner's use. The Free plan has no card on file, so Cloudflare pauses at a limit instead of billing.
- On Linux (development and CI only) the session is kept in memory, so you sign in on every launch. The Mac uses the Keychain and Android the Keystore.
