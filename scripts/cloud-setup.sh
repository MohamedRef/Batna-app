# One-time Batna Cloud setup on your Cloudflare account (Workers Free plan).
# Safe to re-run: it skips what already exists. Needs `wrangler login` first.
# Adapted from Kabar's scripts/cloud-setup.sh (no D1: Batna keeps everything
# in the account's Durable Object). Nothing here is shared with Kabar Cloud.

Done. Next:
  1. Put Batna's Google OAuth client id in crates/server/wrangler.toml → GOOGLE_CLIENT_IDS
     (docs/CLOUD.md §3.2 shows how to create it).
  2. just cloud-deploy
